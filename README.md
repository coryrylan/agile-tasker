<h1>Think Agile Web App Version 0.1</h1>

<h2><a href="http://webdesignis.me/Agile/index.html" target="_blank">Think Agile Web App</a></h2>

<p>A small productivity Web App that simply is a countdown timer. The idea is to work in small sprints to help increase
productivity and efficiency. I have found this invaluable in programming. Take 25 focused minutes on your problem. Then 
take a 5 min break no matter where you are in the problem. This will let you keep your mental edge and recharge.</p>

<p>Please feel free to contribute. I plan on launching and adding the features for a Firefox OS app and a
enabled IOS Web App soon.</p>
